# Supply Chains as Complex Systems
Networks to distribute goods, from raw materials to food and medicines, are the backbone of a functioning economy. They are shaped by several supply relations connecting manufacturers, distributors, and final buyers worldwide. The aggregation of these relations give rise to intricate supply chains that grow more complex every year [1, 2]. This has recently revealed some significant downsides. The Covid-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine have highlighted that even local shortages can be amplified through the supply linkages and ultimately affect millions of people [3–6]. As supply chains grow more complex, they also raise pressing sustainability concerns, regarding environmental degradation, poor labour conditions, and red-flag social issues [7-10]. These events have called for a deeper understanding of supply chain structures and how these structures affect their resilience and sustainability [11].

Traditionally, scholars of supply chain management and operations logistics have conceptualized distribution systems as linear chains. Using this perspective implies that supply chains in principle can be fully designed by a single manufacturer [12–14]. However, nowadays, this conventional approach falls short. While firms could choose their partners, they have limited control over the business relations of those partners [15]. In other words, the connections within the distribution system extend beyond the control of a single entity, and the resulting structure strongly deviates from a simple chain. Thus, today’s distribution systems should be better viewed as self-organized systems emerging from the interactions of several firms [16, 17]. As recently highlighted [15, 18–20], these self-organized systems can be suitably represented as complex networks. Network science has provided tools to move beyond the oversimplified chain perspective. Yet, research in this direction has been limited by a lack of comprehensive data. Given this limitation, previous research has been constrained to small-scale case studies [21, 22] or simulations without empirical validation [13, 20–25]. Network models validated on large-scale distribution systems are still missing [15].

# Satellite Overview
We advance this research by proposing a satellite that addresses key challenges in supply chain networks. The satellite aims to foster interdisciplinary discussions and identify research gaps by bringing together experts from network science, operations research, and supply chain management. The primary objectives are to explore sustainability of modern supply chains, analyze similarity and differences depending on categories of goods, and compare micro- and macro-level properties of distribution networks. The satellite also welcomes contributions discussing new data and methodological advancements useful for the field.
